## About Trace

Trace is a macOS background application for system-wide search and app launching, similar to Spotlight or Raycast. It's built with SwiftUI and runs as a pure background app with no menu bar or dock presence - activated only via global hotkey (‚å•Space by default).

### Features
- **Fast App Search**: High-performance app discovery and fuzzy search
- **Quick Links**: User-defined shortcuts for files, folders, and web URLs  
- **Background Operation**: Runs invisibly until activated via hotkey
- **Toast Notifications**: Non-intrusive feedback system
- **Customizable Hotkeys**: Configure activation and quick link shortcuts
- **Modern UI**: SwiftUI interface with translucent materials

### Requirements
- macOS 15.5 (Sequoia) or later

## Updating

Trace will auto-update via Sparkle when installed. To manually update via Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade --cask trace
```

## Uninstalling

```bash
brew uninstall --cask trace
```

This will remove the app and clean up associated files in:
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.techulus.trace`
- `~/Library/Caches/com.techulus.trace`
- `~/Library/Preferences/com.techulus.trace.plist`
- And other related files
